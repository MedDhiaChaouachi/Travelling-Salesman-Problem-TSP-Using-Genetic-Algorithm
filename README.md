# Travelling-Salesman-Problem-TSP-Using-Genetic-Algorithm
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities exactly once and returns to the origin city.
